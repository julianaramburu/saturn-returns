<p>I was born and raised in a small town from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I lived there till I was 26, time when I moved to an apartment located in the core of the capital, with my fiancee Daniela.</p>

<p>There, I re-discovered my learning passion and began learning web development. For the past three months I've been doing this, focusing my learning on Front-End languages like HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I felt butterflies in my stomach! I'm sure that this is my real passion so I'm embracing this change with all my soul and hearth. I want a career change that would allow me fulfill all my dreams.</p>

<p>I felt super excited about this change in my life that has repercuted positively in all aspect of it, so I decided to start blogging my journey, so everyone that is in the same spot that I am now, could benefit from my experiences.</p>
